# NIght-Crew

Night crew is a 4 player co-op game being developed by me.

You and up to 4 friends split rent at a shoddy apartment. Water’s yellow, ceiling’s cracked, and you’re one missed payment from getting kicked to the curb. Out of options, you all pick up the night shift at Ribbitz, a grimy 24-hour fast food spot off the highway. Cheap uniforms, busted AC, and a manager who may or may not be, a cult leader.

There are many game elements planned for development such as random "rules" your manager sets for surviving the night while also doing your closing tasks.
There is also a planned system where your manager or the slacking day crew are able to deduct your pay based off of closing performance.
You have a set amount of time to complete your closing tasks and remember. NO OVERTIME
